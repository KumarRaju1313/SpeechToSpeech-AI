# üé§ Speech-to-Speech LLM Bot

This is a voice-based chatbot project where users can talk to a bot, and it talks back! It listens to your voice using your microphone or webcam, understands your message using a powerful language model, and responds out loud ‚Äî all in real time.

This project combines **speech recognition**, **natural language processing**, and **text-to-speech** in a single pipeline using state-of-the-art models like **Whisper** and **LLaMA 2**.

---

## üîç What this project does

- Takes input from the **microphone**, **webcam (audio)**, or **manual text**
- Converts your voice into text using **Whisper**
- Uses **LLaMA 2** to generate a smart and relevant reply
- Converts that reply into voice using **pyttsx3**
- Plays the response back to you like a real conversation

This makes it feel like you‚Äôre talking to an actual assistant.
